Agenda
1) Git 
2) Git Workflow

Why need github?

1) old code lost
2) backups issue
3) not proper sharing

We can't even think like that?

how do we handle these kind of scenarios?

Version Control System -> 
what is vcs?
benefits
1) stores history of changes made to each and every file.

1) why / what / when / who of a change

you did that you commit

lets revart that changes?

just imagine, ever be practically is possible?

centralize the repository?

makes collaboration easy

who changes did this?

every thing is tracked 

who uses vcs?

1) developers, testing, devops team, manager, product manager.. corporate level.. can we use at individual level?

own personal project? 

daily sitting, and do some changes

just commit, and push code, evently, you 

features of changes,

revert a feature, complete control of 

go back to your changes..

its become easy for you..

just helps in better..

vcs is individual level, and enterprise

Git is most common version control system..


Open Source version control system.. inherit at any level, lets you do that own version control system..

Github
Gitlab
BitBucket

- mkdir - means to create directory
- -p - means represent as a parent, if not have then create by yourself.
- ~/ - means home directory
